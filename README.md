Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a story and have asked the user to input various nouns, adjectives, and verbs so they can create different versions of a story. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to add some final touches and ensure everything is correct. I also want to add something else to my project, such as some sort of graphic, image, or different colored fonts if possible. 
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far, I have not encountered any problems in my madlibs project.
